## Past and Present

### Description

Like many concepts/technologies in security, cryptography is not new.  Centuries of devisings ways to send messages between and among 
known and trusted senders/receivers while making those messages unreadable for enemies or anyone else for whom the message is not intended.
Secret codes, etc. 

### <span style="color:blue;">Example</span> / <span style="color:red;">Quiz</span>

*TODO: Make Example or Quiz Question*

```elixir

```

## Types and Algorithms

### Description
Different types depending on
-how data gets chopped up to be encrypted
-how many keys are involved in the encryption/decryption process 
-how the keys get generated/used (symmetric/asymmetric)
-key size
-number of cycles
-for complex algorithms etc..

Old (Cracked - don't use)
DES,etc.

Newer (Resilient/proven secure by industry)
AES

## Related Concepts

### Description

Hash - Sometimes implemented alongside encryption but has a different purpose
Digital Certificates - Application of cryptography/private keys
Encoding - Can be confused because it is also a way to represent data that looks different from it's plaintext start

## Security Concerns

Key Management
Hardcoding keys in code
Old/Cracked protocols 

Recommendations
-Recommended algorithms
-Sources for publishing notices when algorithms become cracked/obsolete and new
